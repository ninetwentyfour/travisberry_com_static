After Effects is an incredibly powerful motion graphics editor. One of the more powerful things inside of After Effects is expressions. Expressions give you much greater control over your animations and can automate things that are not possible with key frames and filters alone.

Learning to use expressions is not hard but it does takes some work. Here are 5 resources to help you on your way. 

Some are tutorials while other are example scripts but all should help you become a scripting ninja in no time.

[http://aescripts.com/]( http://aescripts.com/) This site has a lot of useful scripts. Some cost money but some are pay what you want.

[http://xscriptorium.com/](http://xscriptorium.com/) Another script repository, quite large.

[http://www.yenaphe.info/top-10-scripts-for-after-effects-for-workflow-enhancement/](http://xscriptorium.com/) A good blog post to highlight some of the more useful expressions.

[http://forums.adobe.com/community/aftereffects_general_discussion/aftereffects_expressions]( http://forums.adobe.com/community/aftereffects_general_discussion/aftereffects_expressions) What a better place to learn about After Effects than Adobe.

These sites are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to After Effects expressions. Know of some other really good resources? Let me know in the comments.

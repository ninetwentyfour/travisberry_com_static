Holy cow! The hardest quarter of school is over. So for the last 6 months I have had to create 5 commercials, a 5 minute fiction piece, and a 5 min non-fiction piece. 

All in all it went well for the most part, just a lot of work when combined with other classes and work. 

Well it's over now with me having passed review last Friday. You can see the 7 videos on my [video](http://www.youtube.com/user/ninetwentyfour) page. Go have a look and feel free to leave a comment about them on this page.

And congrats to Aspen, Henry, and Kelly who also passed.

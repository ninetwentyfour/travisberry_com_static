[![celebration2](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/celebration2.jpg "celebration2")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ficken/1813744832/)<!--more-->Holy cow! The hardest quarter of school is over. So for the last 6 months I have had to create 5 commercials, a 5 minute fiction piece, and a 5 min non-fiction piece. All in all it went well for the most part, just a lot of work when combined with other classes and work. Well it's over now with me having passed review last Friday. You can see the 7 videos on my [video](http://www.travisberry.com/video/) page. Go have a look and feel free to leave a comment about them on this page.And congrats to Aspen, Henry, and Kelly who also passed.

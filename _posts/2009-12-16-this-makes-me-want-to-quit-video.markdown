WTF?! How? Who? What? My [teacher](http://studiolascala.com/) sent me this, it's from a **photography student** who just took his first video class. This is from a freaking **Fundamentals of Editing** class. I can't believe how good this kid is. He has great things in his future. Oh, and he did the music and sang the song too. Fantastic.

[![](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/designbumpcap.jpg "designbumpcap")](http://designbump.com/)The newest site I have discovered is perfect for designers and web developers to keep up with the latest news. Featuring a reddit or digg style layout, [DesignBump](http://designbump.com/) lets users submit links to the latest and greatest web design news. It not only covers web design, but all forms of design, even fine art.So go over to DesignBump and give it a try. I have a feeling I will be visiting it on a regular basis.Been to DesignBump? What did you think? Let me know in the [comments](http://www.travisberry.com/2010/01/my-new-favorite-site-of-the-week/).

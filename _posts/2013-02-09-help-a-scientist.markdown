Here at Hospitium we are big fans of people pursuing post-grad degrees, especially in the sciences. That's why we were super excited to help out Alison Kennedy-Benson who is doing her M.S. in Anthrozoology. She recently contacted us and asked if we could help spread a survey for her research. Her thesis is focused on selective intake shelter workers which fits nicely with the user base of Hospitium.

If you would like to help out, please fill out the survey below.

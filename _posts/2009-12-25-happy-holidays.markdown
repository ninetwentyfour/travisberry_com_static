[![christmas](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas.jpg "christmas")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/4159310486/)I just wanted to put up a quick post wishing everyone a happy holiday. The last year has been great for me, and I look forward to next year being even better. To all the people in my life that have had a positive impact, I just want to say thank you.

When I was working on a video project this week I came across the need to have my sound effects sound like they are coming through a cell phone and from inside a box.

Turns out there is an extremely easy solution for both, high and low pass filters.

To make something sound like it is coming out of a crappy cell phone speaker put a high pass filter on it. You may have to tweak the settings a little bit to get the effect you want, but that is it.

To solve the other problem of needing a sound to sound like it's coming from inside a box, use a low pass filter. Again, you may need to tweak the settings to get your desired results.

I love when solutions to problems are as simple as this. If you know of any other quick audio tips, let me know in the comments.

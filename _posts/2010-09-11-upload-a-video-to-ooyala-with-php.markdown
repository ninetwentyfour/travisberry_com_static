**EDIT**: [You can find a better/updated Ooyala class here](https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/Ooyala-Uploader).

[Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com/) is a fairly popular video hosting platform. We have started using them where I work, and they seem to be doing a really good job so far. One of the advantages of Ooyala is their nice API. They have some [example code](http://www.ooyala.com/support/docs/backlot_api#example) for you to use, but one feature that was lacking was uploading. They also have a widget that does do uploading but it is handled through Flash, something I wanted to avoid.

This example builds on top of their existing PHP code. Here is the final code. (You're really going to want to copy paste this into a real code editor, my code tag makes me really mess with my formatting. Apologies.)

{% gist 1177051 example1.php %}

Essentially, you want to create an upload form, and post the values to the publish() function. From there you should be good to go.

Iâ€™m sure there is an easier way to do this, so if you know how to improve this, please let me know in the comments.

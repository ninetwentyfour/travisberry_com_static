There are so many great news sites out there. From traditional news, to bloggers, to social submission sites, following them all can be overwhelming. Luckily there are mashups that bring all these wonderful sites to one place. This makes keeping track of the latest and greatest much easier.

Here is a list of 5 awesome news mashup sites.

[JimmyR](http://www.jimmyr.com) My personal favorite site. This could easily over take googles position as my homepage. Plus the guy who runs it is pretty smart and he has a lot of other random good things on his site like tutorials.

[OurSignal](http://oursignal.com/static/about) This one has a pretty cool interface. Don't know if I could use it long term though.

[POPURLS](http://popurls.com/) This is the name most people think of when they think news mashup. Oldie but goody.

[Alltop](http://alltop.com/) This one has more categories than just "news" so it may be worth cecking out if you're looking for something new or specific.

[originalsignal](http://web20.originalsignal.com/) Very tech centered mashup. All internet related news.

Use a different mashup? Let me know in the comments.

This was my old wordpress theme. You can get my current site at [https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/travisberry_com_static](https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/travisberry_com_static)

If you're looking for a simple [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme to use as a framework to modify, why not download mine? 

Built entirely from scratch by yours truly, my theme is super easy to understand and the css is easy to read and customize.

You can grab a copy from my [github page](http://github.com/ninetwentyfour/TravisBerry_com). Just click on the [download link](http://github.com/ninetwentyfour/TravisBerry_com/archives/master) and choose your preferred download format. I'm using github as opposed to hosting it here because the theme is still being worked on. Github makes it much easier to ensure everyone can get the latest copy.

If you get a copy and have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments.

And if you're interested in a completely custom site, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:contact@travisberry.com) and we can discuss your needs.

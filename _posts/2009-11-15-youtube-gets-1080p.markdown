YouTube now streams in up to 1080p. If you're interested in the quality check out this embed below.

<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qas5lWp7_R0&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qas5lWp7_R0&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>

You'll notice it takes some seriously fast internet to not have to let it buffer for a while, but it's not unbearable.They have certainly come a long way compared to the early days. 

This is a screencap of the compressed mess that is one of my early uploads.

[![](http://content.travisberry.com/zip_files.jpg "zip_files")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/striatic/443918201/)Uploading files with PHP is covered to death on the internet. The other side of that, downloading files, is not covered nearly as much. When a user uploads say, hundreds of images to a folder, and they want to download them all later, it can turn into a giant time sink making them download the files one at a time.A better alternative would be to offer the files individually and with a "Download All As Zip" link.<!--more-->I found a solution [here](http://www.trash.net/~ck/ontheflyzip/), but it required putting the php file in every directory you would like to zip. Not exactly the best solution. So I tweaked it to be a bit more dynamic.This code is based on the assumption that there is a folder called something like _user_uploads_ with a sub-folder for each user, something like _Travis_Berry_``<?php //Get the directory to zip    $filename_no_ext= $_GET['directtozip'];    // we deliver a zip file    header("Content-Type: archive/zip");    // filename for the browser to save the zip file    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$filename_no_ext".".zip");    // get a tmp name for the .zip    $tmp_zip = tempnam ("tmp", "tempname") . ".zip";    //change directory so the zip file doesnt have a tree structure in it.    chdir('user_uploads/'.$_GET['directtozip']);        // zip the stuff (dir and all in there) into the tmp_zip file    exec('zip '.$tmp_zip.' *');        // calc the length of the zip. it is needed for the progress bar of the browser    $filesize = filesize($tmp_zip);    header("Content-Length: $filesize");    // deliver the zip file    $fp = fopen("$tmp_zip","r");    echo fpassthru($fp);    // clean up the tmp zip file    unlink($tmp_zip);?>``Save this code as zip_folders.phpThen when you want to provide a link to download a users uploads as a zip file, you link to it like,``[Download All As Zip](zip_folders.php?directtozip=THE USERS DIRECTORY)``That will cause a download prompt to appear for the user when clicking on the link.You'll notice I use the [system Zip command](http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_zip.htm) as opposed to the [PHP Zip extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php). For more complex Zipping needs, it looks like it would be a better alternative. For something simple like this, I find the system call sufficient.If you find this post useful, or have any PHP Zip tips, let me know in the comments.<script>utmx_section("contact1")</script><div id="contactme"><div class="avatar">![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9e8248c1237949b66a735bed64ae841?s=32&d=identicon&r=G)</div>I'm just a guy interested in all things design and web related.

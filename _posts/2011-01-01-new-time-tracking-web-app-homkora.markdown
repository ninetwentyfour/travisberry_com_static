![](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/homkora-cap.jpg "homkora-cap")I have recently launched the beta my new side project Homkora. <!--more-->Homkora is a [time tracking web app](http://homkora.com) that aims to be as simple as possible. I was not happy with any of the offerings I found so I made my own. It let's you make projects and timers. That's it. You can check the code out at [github](https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/Homkora).Sign up for the beta [here](http://homkora.com/sign-up).

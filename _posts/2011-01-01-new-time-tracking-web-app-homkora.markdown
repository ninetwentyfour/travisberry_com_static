I have recently launched the beta my new side project Homkora. 
<div class="clearfix"></div>
Homkora is a [time tracking web app](http://homkora.com) that aims to be as simple as possible. I was not happy with any of the offerings I found so I made my own. It let's you make projects and timers. That's it. You can check the code out at [github](https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/Homkora).

Sign up for the beta [here](http://homkora.com/sign-up). Try it out and let me know what you think in the comments.

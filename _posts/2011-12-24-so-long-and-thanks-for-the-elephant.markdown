This domain as well as any other domain I own has just been moved to [name.com](http://name.com).

Godaddy has a pretty crappy past of [elephant murder](http://mashable.com/2011/03/31/godaddy-ceo-elephant/) and [SOPA](http://vimeo.com/31100268) support so I decided it was time to no longer support such a company.

Name.com on the other hand is a local Denver company that seems to be on the up and up. So far they have been super awesome to work with.

If you are looking to transfer you can see how to do so [here](http://blog.name.com/2011/12/getting-on-our-sopa-box-and-saving-you-money/).

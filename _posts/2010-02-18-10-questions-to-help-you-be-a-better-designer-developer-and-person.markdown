[![Image by Wordle](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wordleteachings.jpg "Image by Wordle")](http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/519211/Shodoka_-_Song_of_Freedom)One way to help improve your skills and your general well being is to take some time to reflect. Reflection time is when we create permanent memories and draw conclusions based on our lives. With out proper time to reflect, it can feel like your life is in a constant whirlwind. These ten questions are meant as a way to reflect on the way design and development impacts your life, and the way your life impacts the way you design and develop. Answering these questions can help bring clarity and focus to ones life.<!--more-->- What parts of design, development, and life do you like?
- How can I make the world around me a simpler and better place to live?
- How does my artistic expressions affect those around me?
- Is my design, or life, following trends or breaking new ground?
- Do I place more value on the work of an individual or a group?
- Where is design, development, and your life headed two stages from now? (i.e. not the next â€œtrendsâ€ but the ones after that)
- If you could design or develop something for one person, company, or concept, who or what would it be? Why? Is that person, company, or concept important to the way you live your life?
- Is there an ethical boundary I use when determining who or what to work on? Where are your limits on being paid for work? Would you work with someone or something you are strongly opposed to if the money was right?
- What do you see as the greatest moment of luck in you life? How can you repeat the success?
- What is the number one thing holding you back from achieving your next goal?
There are many questions I could continue to add. I think sticking with a moderate amount of questions each time you do an exercise like this is the best way to go. You will spend more time on each as opposed to feeling like you need to complete a giant list. This is supposed to be relaxing, not something that adds to the stress.However, if you have a question you find yourself asking time and time again, let me know in the comments.<script>utmx_section("contactme2")</script><div id="contactme"><div class="avatar">![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9e8248c1237949b66a735bed64ae841?s=32&d=identicon&r=G)</div>

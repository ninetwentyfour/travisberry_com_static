![whitewhale](http://www.travisberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/whitewhale.jpg "whitewhale")It's a new year. A time when everyone is reflecting on the past year and setting resolutions for the new. Screw resolutions. Resolutions are what you make and know damn good and well you're never going to do. This is my list of goals. Things I whole heartedly intend to accomplish and undertake in the new year.<!--more-->1. 1. Finish School.
2. 2. Be able to afford first school loan payment.
3. 3. Start filming White Trash Mutant Attack!
4. 4. Work on a national campaign.
5. 5. Learn Ruby on Rails
6. 6. Buy a Red Scarlet. Assuming they actually come out.
7. 7. Travel to another country. Even something lame like Canada.
8. 8. Get back into riding BMX
9. 9. Be more sociable. Seriously.
10. 10. Continue to live one of the best and luckiest life's on the planet. It's great to be me.
So there you have it. My 10 goals for 2010. If you have goals for the new year, let me know in the comments.

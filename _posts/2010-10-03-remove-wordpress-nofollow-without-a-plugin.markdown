And even better, do so without modifying the WordPress core files. It's really quite simple.
<div class="clearfix"></div>
In your templates functions.php file add 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1177082.js?file=example1.php"></script>

Then in your comments.php file, find and replace any mention of

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1177082.js?file=example2.php"></script>

With

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1177082.js?file=example3.php"></script>

This simply replaces the core files "comment_author_link()" function with one of our own. The original has

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1177082.js?file=example4.php"></script>

as the link. We simply remove the rel attribute and change it to

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1177082.js?file=example5.php"></script>

and it removes the nofollow attribute from your comments. No modifying of the core files, and one less plugin to deal with.

If you have tips for removing other plugins and using your own solution, let me know in the comments.

And even better, do so without modifying the WordPress core files. It's really quite simple.
<div class="clearfix"></div>
In your templates functions.php file add 

{% gist 1177082 example1.php %}

Then in your comments.php file, find and replace any mention of

{% gist 1177082 example2.php %}

With

{% gist 1177082 example3.php %}

This simply replaces the core files "comment_author_link()" function with one of our own. The original has

{% gist 1177082 example4.php %}

as the link. We simply remove the rel attribute and change it to

{% gist 1177082 example5.php %}

and it removes the nofollow attribute from your comments. No modifying of the core files, and one less plugin to deal with.

If you have tips for removing other plugins and using your own solution, let me know in the comments.
